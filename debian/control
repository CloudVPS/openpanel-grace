Provides: libgrace
Description: The grace library
 C++ has gotten a bad rep and attracted a lot of haters. Still, the language is 
 far from dead and not very likely to die any time soon. Lots of effort has been
 put, through various projects, into creating systems and libraries that hide 
 some of the more ugly parts and ease programming. Grace is one of those 
 attempts. It is a project that has grown over a couple of years to introduce,
 through a combination of useful classes and clever macros, clear and easy ways
 to perform a lot of computing tasks in C++.
